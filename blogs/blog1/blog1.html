            Hello internet and happy new year everyone! Today marks the first day that my personal portfolio website goes live. I am excited to continue
            developing it as I progress in my career in Computer Science. As a matter of fact, this is one of my very first front-end projects. I just started
            learning front-end development during this winter break. 
        </p>

            Since this is my very first blog, here's a little bit about me. 
            My name is Jeffrey Lu and as of this date I am in my second year of Computer Science at McMaster University. 
            There's nothing I value more in life than being a well-rounded individual. Some of my hobbies include playing Softball in the summer, working out, 
            playing the Saxophone and continuing to meet lots of talented and amazing people around the world. Of course, being a Computer Science major, I am passionate
            about all things technology and cannot wait to see how this field will change and evolve in the future. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If I were to pick one strand of technology that I am following most closely, it would have to be artificial intelligence. 
            I think this strand has limitless potential to change lives around the world and continue to become more and more powerful 
            as time progresses. I'm so excited to see what our leading computer scientists will discover in the future about this field!
